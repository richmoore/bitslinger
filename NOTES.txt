SSL Mode
========

Auto            MITM plain text, transparently switching to MITM SSL when the client starts talking SSL
Strip Client    Client connection plain text, server connection SSL
Strip Server    Client connection SSL, server connection plain text
None            Always treat the connections as raw bytes

** Strip server mode is dodgy at the moment - we don't have a server cert to clone, so we need to add some logic
to make one based on something else.

Ideas
=====

* Export message

* Decode client hello

* Add latency to the messages

* Export connection to a text file. Ideally in a form that can be replayed

* Send a connection to the repeater
